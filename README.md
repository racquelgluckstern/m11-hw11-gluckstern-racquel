# Bootstrap Webpage Assignment 11  
**By: Racquel Gluckstern**

The project includes professional information about my background, hobbies, interests, and career goals.


### **1. Mobile-Responsive Navbar**  
I used Bootstrap’s built-in **navbar component**, including the mobile-responsive toggle menu.  
All have attributes and IDs so the mobile dropdown functions correctly.

### **2. Responsive Bootstrap Grid**
The page uses the **Bootstrap grid system** to organize content into responsive columns.  
On smaller screens, all columns stack correctly for mobile accessibility.

### **3. Use of Spacing Utilities**
Bootstrap’s margin and padding utility classes (such as `py-5`, `mb-3`, `g-4`, etc.) are used throughout the layout to ensure proper spacing without custom CSS.

### **4. Two Additional Bootstrap Components**
I used the following components:
- **Cards** – used in the Hobbies & Interests section  
- **Buttons** – included inside each card  

These "interactive" items help visually structure the information and improve user experience.

### **5. Minimal Custom CSS**
A separate `style.css` file is linked to the project.  
It includes only light stylistic changes such as:
- font styles  
- heading color  
- minimal button color adjustments
